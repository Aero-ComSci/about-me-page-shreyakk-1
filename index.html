        <p>Career goal: Ideally, I would be working in a laboratory setting, advancing the field of research. I want to participate in research one way or another, whether it is by involving myself in the scientific uses of software to test medicines, or to create them myself in a lab. I want to achieve this goal by gaining as much research experience within highschool. I have already joined a research program, and will hopefully soon be working in a lab on my own.</p>
        <p>Qualities: I possess qualities such as being cooperative, adaptable, and creative. My creativity will allow me to solve problems in various ways, even when a clear pathway seems to be impossible. Cooperation will allow me to work in a team, and to jointly develop solutions to problems. Adaptability will let me deal with changes, and potentially shifting timelines that come alongside lab work. </p>
        <p>Experience: So far, I have recieved two separate art poster awards, and maintained a 4.0 gpa. I am president of the science olympiad club, and this process is teaching me perseverance and how to be a good public speaker. I am currently in an orchestra class, and I worked hard in order to catch up my violin skills after a long break. My schedule involves several advanced classes, and all of these help me learn more subject material and how to improve my learning abilities. I am in the spring semester of a research program, in which I will be participating in order to produce real scientific results. </p>
        <p>I want to someday work in the field of science, one way or another. I hope what I am doing now is setting me on that track. Thank you for reading. </p>
